2. **Users**

3. **Editors / Moderators**
   Highly trusted small community (fewer than 20) who volunteer to review and approve contributions from Users. Their decisions are taken according to clearly defined policies.
4. **Administrator**

### Success metrics

- Unique weekly visitors
- Community data contributions

## 3.1 Building - Phase 1

**Objective**

1. Augment [Palestine Dataset](https://data.techforpalestine.org/docs/datasets/) by adding cumulative version history to MoH updates - eg. if a record is new, modified or deleted. In the absence of date of death, the date between a records first entry vs the previous version provides a window of time for date of death.

**Foundations**

- Open source responsive web app hosted on secure, conscientious tech
- Geolocated language default, with language switch (Arabic/English initially)
- English language codebase and database records

**Admin functionality**

- Authentication for admin
- MoH data management
  - Sequentially upload as bulk files every MoH data release
    - Labelling and dating the bulk upload
  - Resolve difference - create/update/delete
  - Version history of changes (new, edited, deleted)
  - Delete previous bulk file uploads (in case of error)

**Visitor functionality**

- Export full or filtered data as CSV or JSON
- Filter by age and gender
- Filter by bulk file attributes:
  - First created (which release was this death first part of)
  - Last update (has this record been edited)
    - MoH edited (ie. parts of record changed in subsequent bulk files)
    - MoH deleted (ie. record deleted in subsequent bulk files)
- Viewing individual record with all available data and every version of this record (and time of edit)

## 3.1 Building - Phase 2

**User functionality**

- Visitors can sign up as Users
- Users can flag a record (duplicate or inaccurate) or add personal details (eg. images, details of death, where they lived)

**Moderator functionality**

- Admin invite Editors to the platform
- Editors manage an inbox of prioritised contributions
  - Contributions are resolved with accept / decline / escalate
  - Every version of a record contains the details of contributions and resolution details (eg. user, editor, date, notes)
  - This enables full transparency and tracking of community contributions and moderator decisions
